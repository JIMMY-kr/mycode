      "wearingan embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, \n",
      "and hadstars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat \n",

      "not only spoke butthought, and with the gentle, patronizing \n",
      "intonation natural to aman of importance who had grown old in \n",
      "society and at court. He wentup to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her \n",
